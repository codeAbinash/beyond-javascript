<h2>What is JavaScript</h2>
<p>
    <span class="bold">JavaScript is a High Level, Lightweight, Single threated, interpreted
        or Just in time compiled, dynamic language with first class functions.</span>
</p>

<p>JavaScript is most <span class="bold">Popular</span> ðŸ˜¯ programming language in the world ðŸŒŽ! But one of
    the popular
    misconception ðŸ¤” about JavaScript is, people think that "Java" and "JavaScript" are same. (See a <a class="plink" data-meme="js_is_not_js">meme</a>).
</p>
<p>
    No! Java and JavaScript are not same thing. They both are completely different programming languages!
</p>

<p>JavaScript is everywhere! It is in Browsers, Servers, Mobile Apps, Desktop Apps,
    Smart Watches etc. JS is used as front-end in browsers as well as backend in servers
    with the help of Node.js.
</p>

<h2>History of Javascript</h2>
<p>
    JavaScript was created by <span class="bold">Brendan Eich</span> in 1995 just in 10 days for <span class="bold">Netscape Browser</span>. Became the <span class="bold">ECMA-262</span> standard in 1997.
    It was originally named <span class="bold">Mocha</span> and later known as JavaScript. Now <span class="bold">Mozilla</span> foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the <span class="bold">Firefox</span> Browser.
</p>
<h2>Javascript Engine</h2>
<p>
    It is a software that <span class="bold">executes JavaScript code</span>. JavaScript engine is a part of modern browsers,
    when javascript was invented, it was an interpreted language. But now modern browsers use just in time (JIT)
    compilation to improve performance. JavaScript engine is used not only in browsers but also it is a core
    component of Node.js. Example of some famous JavaScript engines are -
</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="bold">V8 engine</span> by Google for Google Chrome</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Spider monkey</span> by Mozilla for Firefox Browser</li>
    <li><span class="bold">JavaScriptCore</span> by Apple for Safari Browser</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Chakra</span> by Microsoft for Internet Explorer</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Chakra</span> was used by Microsoft Edge browser, but now it uses V8 engine</li>
</ul>

<h2>What happens inside JavaScript engine?</h2>
<p>
    JavaScript engine converts high level code into machine readable code. Different JavaScript engines use different
    techniques to get the job done. Some engines use interpreter and compiler both (e.g. V8 engine).
</p>
    Google chrome's JavaScript V8 engine works like this -
<p>

</p>
<div data-image="intro/js engine.jpg"></div>
<p>
    First JavaScript source code goes to Parser. Manly it checks for syntax. Breaks the codes into token.
    <br><br>
    Now these tokens are converted to AST(Abstract Syntax Tree) it allows
    interpreter to read the code and understand.
    <br><br>
    Now AST goes to Interpreter to get converted into Byte code.
    In V8 engine it is known as <span class="bold">Ignition</span>.
    <br><br>
    If there is repeating code, it will decrease the performance of interpreter.
    <span class="bold">Profiler</span> will check for repeating codes.
    To increase performance of execution <span class="bold">Profiler</span>
    moves repeating code to compiler.
    <br><br>
    Compiler generates byte code. Byte code executes to do specific task.
    In V8 engine this compiler is called as <span class="bold">TurboFan</span>.
</p>

<h2>What can we do with Javascript?</h2>
<p>
    JavaScript is a cross platform programming language. We can use it to build dynamic webpages that will work
    on multiple platform(As <span class="bold">front-end</span>). We can use Javascript in <span class="bold">back-end</span> too, using <span class="bold">Node.js</span>. We can build <span class="bold">desktop or mobile applications</span> with the help of some JavaScript frameworks and libraries (e.g. <span class="bold">React Native</span>, <span class="bold">Electron.js</span>). JavaScript is everywhere {<a class="plink" data-meme="js_is_everywhere">meme</a>}. JavaScript has a very large community of developer{<a class="plink" data-meme="js_community">meme</a>}.
</p>


<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
    Open developer tools in a modern browser.
    (<span class="incode">F12</span> or
    <span class="incode">ctrl</span> +
    <span class="incode">shift</span>+
    <span class="incode">I</span>).
    Or setup your favorite code editor or IDE to write JavaScript code.
</p>

<h2>Hello World</h2>
<p>
    If you are learning a new programming language, you have to write "Hello World".
    "It's the lawðŸ˜…"{<a class="plink" data-meme="say_hello_world">meme</a>}. Let's Write "Hello World".
</p>



<div class="js code" data-code="intro/Hello World.js"></div>
<div class="console">Hello World</div>
<p>
    Output will be visible in <span class="bold">console</span>.
</p>

<p>
    JavaScript is case sensitive, means <span class="incode">hello</span>
    and <span class="incode">Hello</span> are not same.
</p>

<div class="js code" data-code="intro/case sensitive.js"></div>
<div class="console">Hello, How are you?<br>Hii</div>

<p>
    Don't worry if you don't understand <span class="incode">let</span> ,
    <span class="incode">console</span> and <span class="incode">log</span>.
    You will read about them in next chapters. For now, just notice
    <span class="incode">hello</span> and <span class="incode">Hello</span>
    are not same.
</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>
    <span class="bold">Syntax</span> of a computer language is the set of rules that defines
    the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured statements or
    expressions in that language. JavaScript Syntax is similar to C, C++.
</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>
    Comments are not executed by JavaScript. They are ignored.
    Comments in JavaScript are same as in C++.
</p>

<div class="js code" data-code="intro/comments.js"></div>
<div class="console">15</div>

<p class="note">
    Nested comments are not allowed.
    <span class="incode">/* Comment1 /* Comment2 */ Comment3 */</span>
</p>

<h2>Expressions</h2>
<p>Any unit of code that can be evaluated to a value is an <span class="bold">expression</span>.</p>
<div class="js code" data-code="intro/expression.js"></div>


<h2>Statement</h2>
<p>
    A <span class="bold">statement</span> is a syntactic unit of a programming language that expresses
    some action to be carried out. Simply, a <span class="bold">statement</span> is complete part of code commanding
    a task. JavaScript statements end with Semicolon. But it is optional (using semicolon
    at the end of each statement is recommended by many developers).
</p>

<div class="js code" data-code="intro/statement.js"></div>

<p>
    If we have to write more than one statement in one line, we have to use semicolon to separate each statement.
    Otherwise it is optional.
</p>
<div class="js code" data-code="intro/semicolon.js"></div>
<p>
    JavaScript ignores multiple whitespace. Using one whitespace makes the code more readable.
</p>
<div class="js code" data-code="intro/whitespace.js"></div>


<p>
    To break a long statement, best practice to break it after an operator.
</p>

<div class="js code" data-code="intro/break line.js"></div>


<h2>Keywords</h2>
<p>
    JavaScript <span class="bold">Keywords</span> are predefined, reserved words used in a program that has special
    meanings to the compiler or interpreter.
    Some examples of javascript keywords are : 
    <span class="incode">var</span> ,
    <span class="incode">let</span> , <span class="incode">if</span> ,
    <span class="incode">else</span> , <span class="incode">while</span> etc.
    <a class="plink" data-link="other/All Keywords">See all Keywords</a>.
</p>

<h2>Identifiers</h2>
<p>
    An <span class="bold">Identifier</span> is a sequence of characters in the code that identifies a variable, function, or property.

    In JavaScript, identifiers are case-sensitive and can contain Unicode letters,
    <span class="incode">$</span>,
    <span class="incode">_</span>, and digits
    <span class="incode">0-9</span> but can not
    start with a digit.
</p>


<h2 id="code_block">Block or Code Block</h2>
<p>
    To group multiple JavaScript statements , we have to use
    <span class="incode">{ }</span> curly brackets. Code inside those curly brackets are called
    <span class="bold">Block</span> or <span class="bold">Code Block</span>. Code inside
    curly brackets <span class="incode">{ code }</span> works like a single statements.
    We can use block to group multiple statements or zero statement into one where JavaScript
    expects single statement. If we need not to provide any statement (zero statement), we can use empty block.
</p>
<div class="js code" data-code="intro/block.js"></div>
<div class="console">1 2 3 <br>Hey Hello World</div>

<h3 id="labeled_block">Labelled Block</h3>
<p>
    Block having specific name are called <span class="bold">Labeled Block</span>.
    We will meet Labeled Block again while coding nested loops.
    This label name is used to <span class="incode">break</span> from that
    targeted (labeled) block in nested blocks.
</p>
<div class="js code" data-code="intro/labeled block.js"></div>
<div class="console">Hello Pekachu</div>

<p class="note" style="line-height: 1.7em;">
    I am using <span class="incode">lowerCamelCase</span> for examples here.
    (Other : <span class="incode">under_score</span>,
    <span class="incode">hyp-hens</span> (Not valid in JavaScript)
    <span class="incode">UpperCamelCase</span>)
</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>
    Scope is the area where variables can be accessed or referenced. E.g. <span class="bold">Function scope</span> (inside a function),
    <span class="bold">Block scope</span> (inside a block) and <span class="bold">Global Scope</span>.
</p>
<div class="js code" data-code="intro/scope.js"></div>
<p class="note">We will learn more about scope later.</p>



<h2>Literals</h2>
<p>
    Literals represents fixed values in JavaScript. Literals are not variables.
</p>
<h3>Example </h3>
<div class="js code" data-code="intro/literal.js"></div>

<span class="bottomText">In the next chapter you will learn about JavaScript variables.</span>
